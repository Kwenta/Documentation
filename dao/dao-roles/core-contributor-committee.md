# Core Contributor Committee

This entity is managed and organized by Core Contributors. Core Contributor Committee members will hold a reserve of the Kwenta token (outlined in the [tokenomics proposal](../../tokenomics/kwenta-tokenomics.md) as the Core Contributor allocation) as well as funding used for routine protocol expenses and Core Contributor payroll. Should additional funding be needed, the Core Contributor Committee will work with the treasuryDAO. This entity will ensure that Core Contributors will have stability under all market conditions.
