# devDAO

A community-oriented development structure that rewards community developers for closing outstanding tickets by having their code merged as well structured compensation for long-term community members. This sub-DAO will include a community PM, various developer roles, and auditor roles.

This sub-DAO has not yet launched, stay tuned for updates in our [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/Kwenta).

Before helping out at the Kwenta devDAO, make sure you have a look at our [developer contribution guideline](../contribute/devdao-contribute.md).

## Why a devDAO

By opening development to the Kwenta community, not only will the DAO accelerate progress but it will also gain resiliency as Core Contributors become less of a crux for product development. To achieve full decentralization, open development is essential.

## Roles within the devDAO

The devDAO will provide an interface where community developers can monitor open tickets with their associated reward. Within the devDAO, there are different roles depending on the level of difficulty of tickets:

### Community PM

The community PM prepares tickets and handles the project management and coordination for community-driven initiatives. This community member will act as the connecting piece between community developers and core contributors.

### Bounty Hunter

Bounty hunters are community members that take on entry-level tickets. These tickets are great for members who just started their journey within the Kwenta community.

### Kwenta Community Dev

Kwenta community developers are vetted individuals that routinely take on intermediate to advanced tickets. As trusted individuals who have proven that they can deliver quality work, higher-level tickets will be reserved for them along with higher tiers of rewards.

### Auditors

An auditor will review code prior to it being merged to ensure there are no bugs and that the code meets the Kwenta community standards. Auditors can be trusted community members given the role by the Community PM, Kwenta community devs that were not responsible for writing the code being audited, or [Core Contributors](core-contributors.md). For a ticket to pass the auditing phase, both a community auditor and core contributor must have audited and approved the code.
