# President

One of the 5 Elite Council members will become the President. The President is elected within the Elite Council, requiring 3/5 members' support. The President will be responsible for the strategic direction of the protocol and will have one additional vote of power representing the equivalent of two Elite Council members.

To become the president, you must first be elected by the community into the Elite Council.&#x20;
