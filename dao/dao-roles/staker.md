# Staker

Platform users who stake their Kwenta will gain voting power in the protocol. This will enable them to vote on election outcomes, proposals the Elite Council deems fit for a broader community vote, and Community Kwenta Improvement Proposals (CKIPs).

To learn more about the staking rewards and how to stake, visit the staking section. \
