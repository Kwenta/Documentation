# Staker

Platform users who stake their KWENTA will gain voting power in the protocol. This will enable them to vote on election outcomes, proposals the Elite Council deems fit for a broader community vote, and Community Kwenta Improvement Proposals (CKIPs).

{% hint style="info" %}
Staking is not yet available and will launch together with the KWENTA token in the near future. Stay tuned for updates in our [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/Kwenta).
