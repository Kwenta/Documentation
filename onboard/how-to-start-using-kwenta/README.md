> **Kwenta works different from traditional exchanges as it:**
>
> 1. Price feeds come from decentralized Chainlink oracles
> 2. There is no order book
>
> Instead, trades executed on Kwenta leverage the Synthetix debt pool (a huge pool of liquidity). This ensures that traders have the liquidity they need at any price point to execute trades. This model requires a liquid and immutable stable coin such as [sUSD](why-susd/).
