# DeFi what is it? How do I start?

### What is DeFi?

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a sector built atop the cryptocurrency industry that brings financial services to blockchains like Ethereum and many others.

DeFi creates fair financial tools that anyone can utilize so long an internet connection is available. DeFi supports tools only banks could make available in the past; users can trade derivatives, options, borrow/lend funds, and often earn high-interest.

### Benefits of DeFi?

* Assets are free to be transferred anywhere at any time.
* DeFi transactions 100% on-chain (transparant).
* You donâ€™t need a basket of self-identifying information to participate.
* Anyone can participate in DeFi. A Web 3.0 wallet and an internet connection is all that's needed
