# Getting started on Optimism

Ethereum Mainnet transactions are increasingly becoming expensive. This ongoing crisis birthed layer 2 scaling solutions like [Optimism](https://optimism.io).

Transactions are processed on a layer 2 network such as Optimism (a network built on top of Ethereum) instead of occurring directly on mainnet Ethereum. The layer 2 solution submits transactions in groups to the Ethereum Mainnet. They are then secured by Ethereums leading security, significantly reducing end-user fees and increasing transaction speed. Optimism states users can save up to 50x in transaction fees.

## Getting started with Optimism

Optimism provides near-instant transactions, lower transaction fees, while providing the same level of security as Ethereum.

{% hint style="info" %}
The upcoming steps assume you already have setup and funded a web3 wallet on Ethereum Mainnet. Make sure you add the [Optimism network](https://chainid.link/?network=optimism) to your web3 wallet. If you need help with setting up a wallet, please follow our [web3 setup guide](https://blog.kwenta.io/installing-metamask) and fund it with Ether (ETH).
{% endhint %}

## Moving assets to Optimism

Using Optimism requires users to bridge Ether (ETH) or other supported ERC-20 tokens to the Optimism network. Making use of the official [Optimism Gateway](https://gateway.optimism.io) bridge makes this process simple and intuitive.

![Main Optimism Bridge Screen](../../.gitbook/assets/onboard/gateway\_main.png)

Connect your wallet by selecting `Connect` and select your web3 wallet provider. Make sure you are connected to `Ethereum Mainnet`.

Once you connected your wallet to the Optimism bridge you can choose supported assets and the amount you wish to send over to layer 2 Optimism.

Finalize the bridge transaction by selecting `Deposit` and approve the transaction via your connected wallet.

The entire bridging process will take about 5-10 minutes, once complete you are ready to interact with dApps on Optimism.

## Withdrawing assets from layer 2

Withdrawing assets back to layer 1 or Ethereum Mainnet can be accomplished via the same [Optimism Gateway](https://gateway.optimism.io). Instead of selecting `Deposit` users instead use the `Withdraw` function.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are many bridging solutions available. Note that withdrawals processed via the official Optimism bridge are subject to a 7 day challenge period. Withdrawn funds will be unavailable until this 7 day period is complete. Alternatively users can use [other bridges](https://www.optimism.io/apps/bridges) for off-ramp purposes that don't require a 7 day challenge period.
