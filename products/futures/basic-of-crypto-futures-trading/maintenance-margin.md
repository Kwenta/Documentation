# Maintenance Margin

**What is Maintenance Margin?**

Maintenance Margin is calculated based on your positions at different notional value tiers. This means that the Maintenance Margin is always calculated the same way, regardless of what leverage you select. The larger the position, the higher the Maintenance Margin rate. On most exchanges, the Maintenance Margins are high, however, the Kwenta Maintenance Margin is signficiantly less than most, which is more beneficial to traders.

It is important to note that the Maintenance Margin will directly affect the liquidation price. To keep from being liquidated, it is highly recommended to close your positions before the collateral falls below the Maintenance Margin.
