This dashboard will look identical across any of the tradable assets on Kwenta Futures and will be the central information hub for the asset you're currently trading.

**1.** In this box, you'll find all the pertinent information pertaining to your open position. It allows you to navigate between "Your Position", "Orders", and previous "trades". There is quite the information to familiarize yourself with.
