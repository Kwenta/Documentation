# Trading on Kwenta

Before you can begin trading on Kwenta Futures you will need:

1. A [web3 wallet](setup-metamask.md) for your browser
2. The Optimism Ethereum network added to your [wallet](setup-metamask.md)
3. Fund You wallet with sUSD

If you do not have the wallet set up, you can follow the steps outlined [here](setup-metamask.md). If the above has been completed, head over to the [Kwenta Futures Platform](https://v2.beta.kwenta.io/) to begin trading. If you'd like to first get an in-depth overview of everything on the Futures Dashboard, check it out [here](futures-dashboard.md).

#### Main Dashboard <a href="#main-competition-dashboard" id="main-competition-dashboard"></a>

### Getting Started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

Once you have selected the asset you wish to trade, you will be brought to the assets’ main dashboard. (Please note that each market is **isolated** from one another, meaning **any sUSD will only be available to the asset it was deposited to**.)

#### Connecting Your web3 wallet <a href="#connecting-your-web3-wallet" id="connecting-your-web3-wallet"></a>

If your wallet isn’t already connected, you’ll want to hit **‘Connect wallet’** at the top right of the screen and follow any MetaMask prompts.

#### Switching MetaMask Networks <a href="#switching-metamask-networks" id="switching-metamask-networks"></a>

You must be connected to the _Optimism Network_; unless previously changed, it will default to the _Ethereum Mainnet_. You can switch networks by clicking the puzzle icon at the top right of your browser and selecting the MetaMask extension. When MetaMask opens, you can switch networks by clicking **‘Ethereum Mainnet’** and from the drop-down menu select the **‘Optimistic Ethereum’** .Your sUSD balance should now display in the bottom right corner. The balance will match the amount of sUSD you hold in MetaMask.

#### Depositing sUSD into the smart contract <a href="#depositing-susd-into-the-smart-contract" id="depositing-susd-into-the-smart-contract"></a>

sUSD must get deposited into the contract of the asset you wish to trade. This is done by selecting **‘Deposit Margin’** and entering the amount that you’d like to transfer. Once you've decided on how much to deposit, hit **‘Deposit Margin’** once more, triggering another MetaMask request.

#### Removing sUSD out of the smart contract <a href="#removing-susd-out-of-the-smart-contract" id="removing-susd-out-of-the-smart-contract"></a>

Removing sUSD can be done by selecting **‘Edit’**  at the bottom right of your screen. In the pop-up window you can either deposit additional sUSD, or withdraw it by switching to **‘Withdraw’** . You can withdraw max or specify an amount to take out.

#### Opening a Position <a href="#opening-a-position" id="opening-a-position"></a>

You are now ready to open positions on Kwenta's Futures Platform. Let's open a Long position by selecting **'Buy'**. Entering a position size can be done multiple ways: you can either enter the amount you'd like to purchase into the text box, slide the leverage slider, or type in your desired leverage. Once satisfied with your order hit **‘Submit Order’.**  After hitting submit, Kwenta will display a confirmation screen showing the details of your position (**Please note your liquidation Price**). Hit confirm order if you are ready to place the trade.

We have now successfully executed a buy order for sBTC, and our positions tab has been updated to reflect that newly taken position.

#### Closing a Position <a href="#closing-a-position" id="closing-a-position"></a>

Ready to exit your position? The easiest way of closing a position is to hit **‘Close Position’**  in the open positions hero card. This will close your position in its entirety. If only wanting to close the position partially, select **‘short’** and specify the amount you wish to reduce.

For demonstration purposes, we first reduced our position and then fully closed the position using the **‘Close Position’** button.
