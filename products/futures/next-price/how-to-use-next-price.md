# How to use Next Price

Traders on Kwenta will see a new addition to “order types” available on Kwenta. Traders can take advantage of “Next Price Orders” and their matching lower bps fees, by heading to Kwenta, navigating to the ‘Futures’ Tab, and connecting their wallet.​

Once connected traders can select the asset they wish to trade from the ‘Asset Selection Dropdown’ to be taken to the perspective markets dashboard and begin trading. Once traders deposit $sUSD into the market, In the ‘Order Entry’ panel, you’ll see two types of orders.&#x20;

The existing “market order” that will execute a trade at the current market rate (oracle price) instantly with regular exchange fees, and our new Next Price orders, offering a substantial reduction in exchange bps fees.​

Once you’ve toggled to Next-Price you won’t notice a huge change on the order entry Panel, but rest assured as long as Next Price is selected orders will be placed accordingly and traders can submit trades as they normally would.​
