# FAQ

### Where does the liquidity come from?

Kwenta is built on the Synthetix protocol, so the liquidity traders can access on Kwenta is entirely created by SNX stakers on Synthetix.

### How does trading work if there are no counterparts?

There are no direct counterparties for each trade in the Synthetix protocol, but it does use a counterparty-like model in which SNX stakers assume a proportion of the Synthetix debt pool when they mint sUSD. For more details, see the Synthetix [litepaper](https://docs.synthetix.io/litepaper/).
