# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are pre-specified agreements on the Ethereum blockchain that evaluate information and automatically execute when certain conditions are met.

### Synthetix

Kwenta makes use of and is built atop existing Synthetix infrastructure. Security and correctness are paramount goals for any smart contract system. Therefore several different audit partners have been engaged over the history of the Synthetix project in a continuing process to validate the integrity of its smart contract system.

#### Audits

All Synthetix smart contract updates are accompanied by an external security audit performed by [Iosiro](https://iosiro.com/).&#x20;
