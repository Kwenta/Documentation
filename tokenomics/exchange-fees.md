# Exchange Fees

Exchange fees are charged when a trader exchanges one synthetic asset (synth) for another through the Kwenta dApp. Fees are between **20-50 bps** (0.1-0.5%), though usually 40 bps. These fees are sent to the fee pool, where they are available to be claimed by SNX stakers each week.

Exchange fees may vary depending on a selected market. The most current fees are prominently displayed within the Kwenta dApp while trading.
