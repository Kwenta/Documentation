# Aelin Raise

The Kwenta treasury will raise funds via Aelin to fuel DAO development. \
\
Kwenta will sell 5% of the initial token supply (15,668.65 KWENTA) at a 100m USD valuation using the Aelin protocol on Optimism. \
\
**The Pool Details:**

Sponsor: **Kwenta treasuryDAO**

Currency accepted: **$sUSD**&#x20;

Pool length: **Two weeks**&#x20;

Pool Type: **Uncapped\***

Vesting: **N/A**

Please note contributors have 24-hours after the allocation window to accept the deal terms once the buy-in period is closed or they forfeit their allocation (Feb 27th 2022). Contributors who accept their full allocation will then have a 12 hour open window to buy the remaining tokens on a first come, first serve basis. \
\
Pool contributors will receive vKWENTA which will be directly claimable for KWENTA on a 1:1 basis once the token is live (target launch is currently late Q1 - early Q2). vKWENTA will not be stakeable or usable in Kwenta governance, it must be converted to KWENTA to be used within the DAO.

{% hint style="info" %}
\*Uncapped pools, allows anyone to purchase as much as they want but token allocations may be scaled back. As an example if there is 17m sUSD in the pool and the Kwenta tokens are worth $5m (100m FDV @ 15,668.65 tokens) then everyone will get 29/100th of their allocation. Someone who puts in 100k sUSD would only get 29K worth of sUSD in tokens allocated.
