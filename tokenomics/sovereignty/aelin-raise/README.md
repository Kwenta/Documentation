# Aelin Raise

The Kwenta treasuryDAO will raise funds via [Aelin](https://aelin.xyz) to fuel DAO development.

Kwenta will sell 5% of the initial token supply (15,668.65 KWENTA) at a 100m USD valuation using the Aelin protocol on Optimism.

The pool will accept **sUSD** and will be open for a period of 2 weeks starting February 14th, 2022.

> **The Pool Details**
>
> * Sponsor: **Kwenta treasuryDAO**
> * Currency accepted: **sUSD**
> * Pool length: **Two weeks**
> * Pool Type: **Uncapped**
> * Vesting: **N/A**

Please note that pool contributors have a 24-hours allocation window to accept the deal terms once the buy-in period is closed or they forfeit their allocation (Feb 27th, 2022). Once the allocation window closes, contributors who accepted their full allocation will then have another 12-hour open window to buy the remaining tokens on a first-come, first-serve basis.

{% hint style="info" %}
Uncapped pools allow anyone to purchase as much as they want but token allocations may be scaled back. For example, if there are 17m sUSD in the pool and the Kwenta tokens are worth $5m (100m FDV @ 15,668.65 tokens, then everyone will receive 29/100th of their allocation. Someone who puts in 100k sUSD would only get 29k worth of sUSD in tokens allocated.
{% endhint %}

Pool contributors will receive vKWENTA which will be directly claimable for KWENTA on a 1:1 basis once the token is live _(target launch is currently late Q1-early Q2)_. vKWENTA will not be stakeable or usable in Kwenta governance, it must be converted to KWENTA in order to be used within the DAO.
