Once complete (a few seconds) you'll see "My Pool Balance" will reflect your contribution in the Pool dashboard.

**Step 3 - Wait until the Purchase Lock Duration is complete**&#x20;

Now all you have to do is wait until the Purchase Lock Duration (Feb 27th) is complete, then the Kwenta treasuryDAO can create a deal, and contributors have 24 hours to choose to either accept or not accept, partially or in full their token allocation.
