# Reject/Accept Deal

Once the Deal becomes available on Feb 27th, contributors can either:

### **Reject Deal** <a href="#reject-deal" id="reject-deal"></a>

Reject all or a portion of the deal. When you Reject you will receive back your contribution, no fees are charged.

### Accept Deal <a href="#accept-deal" id="accept-deal"></a>

When you accept a deal, you have options. You can either accept all, or just a portion (you'll get back the remaining) once it becomes time to accept the Deal you will run into either of the blow scenarios.

**Scenario 1: Conversion Ratio 1:1**\
****Kwenta pool has $5M sUSD in it and the deal is for $5M sUSD. In this case, for every Pool Token contributors purchased, they'll get a Deal Token.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ex. A contributor who allocated $5000 sUSD to the Pool will receive $5000 sUSD worth of Kwenta
{% endhint %}

**Scenario 2: Conversion Ratio is less than 1:1** (Oversubscribed Uncapped Pool)\
The Kwenta pool has $10M sUSD in it and the deal is for $5M sUSD. In this case, for every Pool Token, contributors get 0.5 Deal Tokens also known as deallocation. You may withdraw your remaining amount at any time or use it for the [Open Redemption Period](reject-accept-deal.md#open-redemption-period).

{% hint style="info" %}
Ex. A contributor who allocated $5000 sUSD to the Pool will receive $2500 sUSD worth of Kwenta as the pool is oversubscribed by 50%.
{% endhint %}

**After accepting the deal:**

* Your Pool Tokens will be sent to the HOLDER
* 2% of the Deal Tokens will be sent to AELIN Token Holders as Protocol Fees

### **Open Redemption Period** <a href="#open-redemption-period" id="open-redemption-period"></a>

This happens when you **max** out your allocation in Scenario 2, making you eligible to participate in the open redemption period. Here you may redeem the remaining Pool Tokens for Deal tokens up until you have used all your funds or the deal cap has been reached.

{% hint style="info" %}
Contributors that accept a partial amount of their allocation cannot participate in the Open Redemption Period.
{% endhint %}

### **Uncapped vs Capped Pools**

Aelin protocol makes use of two kinds of Pool types. Uncapped and Capped. In a capped Pool the cap acts as a hard ceiling and the Pool cannot be oversubscribed, (overbought) this makes it possible that bots and or whales can buy up the Pool ensuring no one else can buy in. While in an Uncapped Pool, the raise can go over the cap, and once it becomes oversubscribed everyones allocation gets scaled back proportionally, allowing for maximum participation.&#x20;
