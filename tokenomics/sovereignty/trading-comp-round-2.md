# Trading Comp Round 2

On Tuesday, a second round of the Futures trading competition will be held on Optimism Mainnet where everyone starts on equal footing. By hosting a second round the following week, people who found out about the Futures competition late will be able to still participate without being at a disadvantage. The week-long competition will be held where participants will compete to generate the most amount of profit with Kwentaâ€™s Futures product, working their way as high up the leader as possible.

The round two prize pool will include 1595 KWENTA:
